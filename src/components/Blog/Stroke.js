                The human brain is an engineering marvel and the most complex
                biological structure in the universe. It is the body's control
                centre and part of the nervous system, including the spinal cord
                and a massive network of nerves and neurons. Thus, any damage or
                disorder of the brain can have multiple effects on individuals'
                bodies with ranging severities--impact on memory, sensation,
                personality, and life in general.
              </p>
              <p className="   py-2 ">
                There are numerous brain disorders, including tumours,
                Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, ASL (Amyotrophic Lateral
                Sclerosis), and many more. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the
                second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder after
                Alzheimer's disease. PD causes nerve cells or neurons in the
                brain that controls movement to weaken or die. Healthy neurons
                produce a chemical called dopamine that the brain needs to
                regulate the body's movement. However, on the other hand,
                weakened neurons produce lower dopamine levels.

              Stroke: Treatment and prevention through awareness
            </p>
            If you had to do all your daily work without using your one hand,
            one leg, and one portion of the face, you might be able to imagine
            how critically stroke-affected patients have to spend their lives. A
            brain stroke causes a severe medical condition due to complications
            in the brain’s blood vessels. The cells in our brains are extremely
            sensitive. Even a little lack in the supply of oxygen and
            carbohydrate causes the cells to start to decay. If the blood flow
            to any part of the brain is hampered (except due to injuries) and
            continues to sustain for twenty-four hours or the patient dies by
            twenty-four hours – then it might be a case of a stroke.
          </p>

            A stroke could be detected through severe symptoms like paralysis;
            in some cases, it might even lead to death. In most cases, one
            particular side of the patient’s body, including hand, leg, and
            face, are paralyzed. If the left side of the brain is affected by a
            stroke, then the right side of the body will be paralyzed, and
            vice-versa. It indicates that the limbs controlled by the affected
            portion of the brain will suffer the impact. The type and severity
            of the stroke determine the type and severity of the paralysis. Many
            of us carry a misconception that stroke and heart attack are the
            same. We have to remember that stroke is not heart disease; it is
            mainly related to our brain. Hospitals have separate specialized
            units for both cardiac and stroke treatments, and different
            specialist doctors for each unit; if a stroke patient is diagnosed
            early and taken to the hospital on time, the chances of their safe
            recovery increases by quite some extent.

            Men are 1.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with PD than women,
            according to Parkinson's Foundation. The disease's risk increases
            with age, but some are diagnosed at early years, like before the age
            of 50. Most of the time, PD is not hereditary, but some people can
            inherit it due to altered genes. According to Harvard Health
            Publishing, numerous studies have shown that individuals can have PD
            if they are exposed to chemicals used in pesticides, herbicides, and
            organic pollutants. Repeated blows on the head can also increase the
            risk of developing PD.

            Stroke symptoms include sudden weakness or unresponsiveness of one
            side of the body, headache, vomiting, sudden fainting, difficulty,
            or inability to speak. A stroke-patient might feel dizzy and have
            severe pain in their head, neck, face, and even between their eyes.
            The patient might face difficulty to walk or balance themselves;
            their words might sound mumbled. Blurry eyesight and nausea can also
            indicate the same. Remembering the acronym ‘FAST’ is recommended to
            diagnose and care for a stroke-patient, where F is for ‘facial
            deformation’ or droopiness, A is for ‘arm weakness’, S is for
            ‘speech impediment.’ T is for ‘Time to seek emergency healthcare’.
            When a patient is found to fulfill these criteria, we must not
            panic. Instead, we have to quickly reach the nearest hospital
            emergency and avail medical attention within the shortest possible
            time. Patients suffered by a stroke could be cured with timely
            medical attention.

            Stroke can be of two types, depending on how it affects the brain.
            These are 1. Ischemic stroke, and 2. Hemorrhagic stroke. If blood is
            clotted inside the brain’s vessels or clotted-blood is circulated
            from the heart or any other limb to the brain – then there are high
            chances of an ischemic stroke. Although the rate of fatality from
            ischemic stroke is comparatively low, the recovery phase for the
            sufferer is longer, and in many cases, patients have to live with
            permanent paralysis. In the case of a hemorrhagic stroke, blood
            vessels are broken, followed by bleeding inside the brain. Signs and
            symptoms in such cases depend on the location and severity of the
            impact on the brain. In most cases, patients arrive at the hospitals
            in an unconscious state or with high blood pressure. The chances of
            death are higher in hemorrhagic strokes. Patients who overcome the
            primary strain have lower chances of facing a second hemorrhage.
            They face a lesser risk of permanent paralysis, and the initial
            paralysis is also cured within a comparatively lesser duration.

              Treatment for Stroke:
            </p>
            Whichever type of stroke a patient suffers from, his/her recovery
            depends mainly on how quickly, efficiently, and properly the primary
            treatment and rehabilitation process is provided. Certain patients
            can be treated by thrombolysis (melting blood-clots using
            injections) and thrombectomy (taking out blood-clots using stents),
            if brought to the hospital within 3 – 4 hours of suffering from an
            ischemic stroke. In other cases, the doctor needs to operate
            extensive investigation and advise medicines and rehabilitations
            accordingly. Besides primary treatments, hemorrhagic strokes can be
            treated by surgery, surgical clipping, or coiling.

          <p className="px-8">
            Few more remedies are recommended to be applied; for example: if
            there is a shortness of breathing or no breathing, then the patient
            needs to be artificially respirated by mouth-to-mouth breathing. If
            the patient is vomiting, then the head needs to be placed sideways.
            Those looking after should remember to not feed the patient anything
            solid or liquid. The respiration, respiratory channel, and blood
            circulation need to be constantly monitored for unconscious
            patients. The patient needs to be laid sideways. Proper care of the
            eyes the bladder should be taken, even using a catheter, if
            required. At least two persons shall be at the hospital along with
            the patient. This will ensure smoother progress of the diagnosis and
            treatment.

              Causes of Stroke:
            </p>
            Over 55-years of age have higher risks of stroke. Men are more
            vulnerable to strokes compared to women. High blood pressure,
            diabetes, cardiac diseases, and obesity are some of the underlying
            causes of stroke. Previous cases of stroke or heart attack in the
            family, smoking or alcohol consumption, heart diseases like
            irregular heartbeat, heart failure, heart infection, hormone therapy
            or birth-control medicines, previous history of one or more strokes
            or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) can also increase the chances of
            a stroke.

              Preventives:
            </p>
            Stroke is mostly preventable. But it is required to raise awareness
            to prevent this disease, which is why all should know about the
            risks of stroke and abide by the rules for a healthy lifestyle. To
            maintain a healthy lifestyle, one should regularly check their blood
            pressure and take necessary steps to keep it under control, avoid
            high-fat foods, control their cholesterol levels, check diabetes
            regularly, keep alert about this, maintain physical exercise, and
            control their weight. Vegetables, small fish, sea-fish, dried fish,
            and milk shall be included in the diet. Patients could face
            paralysis, coma, or even death due to a stroke. But a little
            awareness and timely treatments can result in up to 50% improvement
            of the patients’ condition. A healthy lifestyle can lessen the risks
            of stroke by a large margin. Stroke Day is celebrated around the
            world on October 29 every year. Stroke-related illness and mortality
            are a matter of concern for people all over the world. It is great
            that stroke awareness among the people in our country is now slowly
            increasing. We want to move forward with modern medical management
            of stroke and public awareness about stroke.
